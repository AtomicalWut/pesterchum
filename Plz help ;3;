well basically your a pesterchum helper and i really liked using this chat client and i espicially like homestuck, the problem started a while ago and when it happened i looked for help with it but so far to no avail, my computer version is Mac Os X, so about 5 months after i downloaded pesterchum it was a normal day, i woke up ate breakfast, etc etc, and got on pesterchum to roleplay a little maybe, i opened it and was greeted by a bar with two options, it said Pesterchum Error next to the cheekily smiling icon and had two options.
open console
or
terminate.
opening the console just led to all my logs and exits on it and terminating just closed the bar, i tried both, i terminated it as terminate was highlighted
re-opened
and to no avail as i said before
same thing
open console
or
terminate.
if anyone can help me please do because i've tried everything, and the fact the forums are still down makes it even worse as it takes the chance of fixing it with the debug thing and destroys it
please respond if you know, when it happened i was trying everything and adventually, i was like "meh" and quit.
but i've gained so much boredom without it. so as the title says
Plz help ;3;
